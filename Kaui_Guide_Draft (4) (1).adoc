== PART 1

== What Is Kaui (KAUI)?
"Kaui" (KAUI ) stands for Kill (Bill) Admin User Interface. We think "Kaui" is easier on the eyes than "KAUI."

Kaui is a user interface for Kill Bill. You can use Kaui to perform all sorts of back office tasks related to customer accounts. You can also use Kaui to perform more advanced tasks.

== What You Can Do in Kaui

In Kaui, users can  perform basic tasks, such as:

* Creating a customer account
* Generating a customer invoice
* Canceling a subscription

However, Kaui can also help advanced users perform tasks, for example:

* Adding a plugin to Kill Bill
* Managing Kill Bill users
* Creating tags or custom fields

These are just a handful of the tasks you can accomplish with Kaui. For a full list, see the Table of Contents at the beginning of this guide.

== How to Use This Guide

*Part 1* explains how Kaui is organized and how to perform basic customer service tasks, such as creating accounts, invoices, and so forth. It’s appropriate for back office staff, such as those working in customer service, product management, and finance.

To quickly find what you're looking for, you can use the _Table of Contents_ or our *FAQs*.

*Part 2* explains advanced features of Kaui, for example: customer fields, tags, extensions, and more. It’s appropriate for Kill Bill administrators and software developers.

=== About Screenshots
The screenshots displayed in this guide may differ from what you see on your Kaui screen. That's because your user permissions control what features you can access (i.e., what you see on the screen).

=== Grids/Tables
Grids (a.k.a. tables) appear throughout Kaui to keep lists organized:

image::GridSample.png[]

Below some grids, you can use the pagination controls to view different "pages:"

image::PaginationControls.png[80,500]

To sort columns on a grid, click the up/down arrow in that column's header:

image::ShowSortArrowsOnColumn.png[width=650]

Kaui shows you which column is currently sorted by the purple arrow:

image::ShowSortByColumn.png[width=650]

The direction of the arrow (up or down) indicates if the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.

If relevant, you can click on a link in the grid to view that item's detail. For example, on the Invoices grid, click the link to open that specific invoice:

image::ClickToViewDetail.png[width=650]

=== Basic Search

To search for customer accounts, use the basic search. Basic search is available at the top of the screen no matter where you are in Kaui:

image:ShowTopSearch.png[width=850]

Basic search is also available in the center of the *homepage*:

image:ShowSearchHomepage.png[width=850]

You can search by typing in either the ID or the external key.

*Tip:* To view all accounts, place your cursor in the search field and press the Enter key.

=== Advanced Search

An advanced search can help you find customer account as well as other types of objects in the system, such as invoices, subscriptions, and so forth.

To perform an advanced search:

1. On the homepage, click *Advanced search:*

image:ShowAdvancedSearch.png[width=850]

Kaui displays the Advanced Search popup:

image:AdvancedSearchPopup.png[width=650]

[start=2]
2. In the *Object type* field, select the object type you want to search for:

image:AdvSearch-ObjectTypeDropdown.png[width=650]

[start=3]
3. In the *Search for* field, enter the identifier (ID) of the object you're searching for. (_Example:_ If you're searching for a specific invoice, type in the invoice number.)

[NOTE]
*Note:* In addition to searching with an ID, some object types can be searched for using an external key, such as the customer account.

[start=4]
4. If you want Kaui to search and display the first record in the search results, click the *Fast search* checkbox.

5. Click the Search button. Kaui displays the search results.

[TIP]
*Tip:* At the bottom of the Advanced Search popup, Kaui displays the search syntax. You can copy and paste this advanced search syntax into a basic search field. This is helpful if you frequently perform the same kinds of advanced searches.

_Example:_

image:AdvancedSearchSyntax-Labeled.png[]

//QST: Do we have a list of objects that can have external keys? Or is that something that's customizable for Kill Bill?
//QST: Are "invoice payments" different from "payments?"
//QST: Can you search with partial IDs or partial external keys? Or does it have to be an exact match?
//QST: Can you use any wildcard characters in the search box?
