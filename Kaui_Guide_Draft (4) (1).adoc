== What Is Kaui (KAUI)?
"Kaui" (KAUI ) stands for Kill (Bill) Admin User Interface. We think "Kaui" is easier on the eyes than "KAUI."

Kaui is a user interface for Kill Bill. You can use Kaui to perform all sorts of back office tasks related to customer accounts. You can also use Kaui to perform more advanced tasks.

== What You Can Do in Kaui

In Kaui, users can  perform basic tasks, such as:

* Creating a customer account
* Generating a customer invoice
* Canceling a subscription

However, Kaui can also help advanced users perform tasks, for example:

* Adding a plugin to Kill Bill
* Managing Kill Bill users
* Creating tags or custom fields

These are just a handful of the tasks you can accomplish with Kaui. For a full list, see the Table of Contents at the beginning of this guide.

== How to Use This Guide

*Part 1* explains how Kaui is organized and how to perform basic customer service tasks, such as creating accounts, invoices, and so forth. It’s appropriate for back office staff, such as those working in customer service, product management, and finance.

To quickly find what you're looking for, you can use the _Table of Contents_ or our *FAQs*.

*Part 2* explains advanced features of Kaui, for example: customer fields, tags, extensions, and more. It’s appropriate for Kill Bill administrators and software developers.

=== About Screenshots
The screenshots displayed in this guide may differ from what you see on your Kaui screen. That's because your user permissions control what features you can access (i.e., what you see on the screen).

== Other Learning Resources

=== Glossary

We don't use exotic words in this manual, but some of the terms may have a slightly different meaning from your previous encounters with them. For that reason, we encourage you to review the following terms in the  _Kill Bill Glossary_:

We regularly add new overviews and tutorials to https://www.youtube.com/c/KillbillIoOSS[our YouTube videos], so check in regularly.

At the bottom of some page for some grids, you can use the pagination controls to view different "pages:"

To sort columns on a grid, clicking the up/down arrow in that column's header:

image::ShowSortArrowsOnColumn.png[]

Kaui shows you which column is currently sorted by the purple arrow:

image::ShowSortByColumn.png[]

The direction of the arrow (up or down) indicates if the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.

If relevant, you can click on a link in the grid to view that item's detail. For example, on the Invoices grid, click the link to open that specific invoice:
