== PART 1

== What Is Kaui?
"Kaui" (KAUI) stands for Kill (Bill) Admin User Interface.

Kaui is a user interface for Kill Bill. You can use Kaui to perform all sorts of back office tasks related to customer accounts. You can also use Kaui to perform more advanced tasks.

== What You Can Do in Kaui

In Kaui, users can  perform basic tasks, such as:

* Create a customer account
* Generate a customer invoice
* Cancel a subscription

However, Kaui can also help advanced users perform tasks, for example:

* Adding a plugin to Kill Bill
* Managing Kill Bill users
* Creating tags or custom fields

These are just a handful of the tasks you can accomplish with Kaui. For a full list, see the _Table of Contents_ at the beginning of this guide.

== How to Use This Guide

<<_part_1>> explains how Kaui is organized

<<_part_2>> explains how to perform the basic tasks for administering customer accounts, such as creating accounts, invoices, and so forth. It’s appropriate for back office staff, such as those working in customer service, product management, and finance.

<<_part_3>> explains how to create and manage users as well as users roles and permissions. It’s appropriate for Kill Bill administrators and software developers.

<<_part_4>> covers the advanced features of custom fields, tags and more.

The <<faqs>> are great if you have a basic question like, "How do I create an invoice?"

=== About Screenshots
The screenshots displayed in this guide may differ from what you see on your Kaui screen. That's because your user permissions control what features you can access (i.e., what you see on the screen).

If you have any questions about why your Kaui screen doesn't match what you see in this guide, ask your Kaui administrator.

== PART 2

== Accounts

This section helps you become familiar with customer accounts and the layout of the Account page.

The Account page provides information about a specific customer, such as email address, physical address, and so forth. It is also the central location for the customer's billing information, subscriptions, invoices, and payment methods.

To find a customer in the system, use <<Basic Search>> or <<Advanced Search>>. To open the customer account, click on the customer ID in the search results.

The next section explains how the Account page is laid out. To skip this and see the task-based steps, go to <<Create an Account>>.

=== Account Page Layout

The Account page has the following sections:

1. Sub-menu
2. Account information
3. Billing info
4. Personal info
5. Payment methods

image::AccountPage_Labeled.png[]

*1. Account Sub-Menu*

The Account sub-menu organizes and provides access to different areas of the customer's account:

* Subscriptions
* Invoices
* Payments
* Timeline
* Tags
* Custom Fields

image::Account-Submenu.png[width=450]

To see these areas, click on the relevant item on the sub-menu. To return to the customer's Account page, click *Account* on the sub-menu.

*2. Account Information*

This section of the screen displays a summary of the customer's account information, such as their ID, currency, and time zone. To edit this information, click *Edit* next to Account Information.

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer account:

* <<_edit_an_account>>
* <<_link_to_parent_account>>
* <<_add_a_tag_to_an_account>>

*3. Personal Information*

This section of the screen displays the customer's personal contact information (read only).

By default, Personal Information details are hidden for GDPR Compliance and customer privacy. To see the information, click *Show/Hide Content*.

To edit this information, see the <<_edit_an_account>> section.

*4. Billing Info*

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer:

* Pay all invoices
* Add a credit
* Create a charge

//LINK THE ABOVE LATER

You can also see a summary of billing information:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Field |Description

|Account balance
|Amount of money due on the account, including any account credits.

|Account credit
|Amount of any money owed to the customer.

|Overdue status
|The status of the customer's account that indicates if they are overdue or up-to-date on their invoice payments.

*Note:* The account can have a negative account balance, but not be overdue. That's because overdue status depends on invoice due dates and how late payments are defined based on a company's business policy. For example, an invoice may not be overdue if a company allows a 15-day grace period (a.k.a. NET terms) to make a payment.

|Bill cycle day
|The day of the month on which the system generates an invoice.

|Next invoice date
|The date on which the system generates the customer's next invoice.

|===

The *Trigger invoice generation* feature lets you generate an invoice, either as a test or in a committed state.

*5. Payment Methods*

This section of the Account page lets you:

* <<_add_payment_method,Add a payment method>>
* <<_set_a_payment_method_as_the_default,Set a payment method as default>>
* <<_delete_payment_method,Delete a payment method>>
* <<_applying_transactions_to_a_payment_method,Apply a transaction to a payment method (authorize, charge, credit, etc.)>>

For more information on payment methods, see the <<_payment_methods>> section.

=== Create an Account

image::CreateNewAccount-Labeled.png[width=550]

[start=2]

image::AddNewAccount.png[width=550]

[start=3]
. Fill in the fields. For field information, see the table in the next section.

[start=4]

==== Account Field Information

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Field |Description

|Name
|The customer's first and last name.

|First name length

*Note:* This field is used if your organization needs to extract customers' first or last names for communication (invoices, emails, etc.). The field lets an organization accommodate variations of names used across the globe.

|External key
|An optional alternate ID for the account. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

*Tip:* The external key feature is helpful if you integrate Kill Bill with another system, such as a CRM, and want to use that system's ID in Kill Bill (for identification, searching, and so forth). Once this is set and saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

image::NewContactEmail.png[width=450]

[start=7]
. To add another email address, repeat steps 2 - 5.

==== Delete Additional Contact Emails
[WARNING]
*Warning:* Kaui does not ask you to confirm your deletion; use this feature with caution.

To remove additional contact emails:

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. In the Personal Information section, click the gray down arrow ( image:i_GrayDownArrow.png[] ) to expand the section.
3. Next to the email you want to delete, click the red X ( image:i_RedX.png[] ). Kaui immediately deletes the email address.

Use the steps in this section to indicate you will no longer be doing business with a customer. If the customer has unpaid invoices, using the steps below, you can choose to either write off or item-adjust them.

[NOTE]
*Note:* Closing an account does not delete it. It only indicates the account is no longer a customer of yours. Once you close the account, its data becomes read-only, and you cannot make changes to it.

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. Next to Account Information, click *Close*.

Kaui displays the Close Account pop-up:

image::CloseAccountPopup.png[width=450]

* *Item Adjust Unpaid Invoices*&#8212;Adds an invoice line item with a negative amount to bring each unpaid invoice's balance to zero.

[NOTE]
*Note:* The last two options are mutually exclusive (i.e., you can only select one of them).

[start=5]
. Click the *Close* button.

Kaui displays a message that lets you know the account was closed. In addition, the Account sub-menu displays "Closed":

image::AccountSubmenu-Closed.png[width=450]

=== Add a Tag to an Account

You can attach a tag to an account as a way of communicating information or to starting/stopping an action. Some examples from the default tags that already exist in the system include:

* The `AUTO_INVOICING_OFF` tag stops invoicing the customer account until the tag is removed.
* The `TEST` tag indicates the account is used internally for testing purposes.

For more information on Tags, including a list of default tags, see the https://killbill.github.io/slate/#account-tags[Tag section] in the _REST API Reference Manual_.

To add a tag to a customer account:

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. In the Account Information section, click the tag icon in the upper left corner:

image::AccountInfo-Section-Labeled.png[width=450]

[start=3]
. Select the checkboxes of the tags you want to assign to the account.

image::Account-TagDropdown.png[width=450]

[start=4]
. Click the *Update* button to save your changes.

=== Link to Parent Account

When you link an account to a _parent_ account, the account becomes a _child_ account. Defining a parent-child association between accounts lets you define which entity is responsible for paying the invoice. For more information on this feature, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/ha.html[_Hierarchical Accounts Tutorial_].

1. As a preparation step, open the parent account and copy the account ID in the Account Information section.
2. Open the account that will become the child account.
3. In the Account Information section of the child account, click the plus sign icon (image:i_PlusGreen.png[]) next to the *Parent* field:

image::Account-ParentField-Labeled.png[width=450]

Kaui opens a popup:

image::LinkToParentPopup.png[width=450]

[start=4]
. Click in the *Parent account id* field and paste in the account ID that you copied in step 1.
. To set the parent as responsible for all payments associated with this account, check the *Is payment delegated to a parent?* box. If you do not check this box, the child account is responsible for its own payments.

[start=6]
. Click the *Save* button. Kaui displays the parent account ID as a link in the Account Information section.

image::Account-ParentID-Labeled.png[width=450]

You can open the parent account by clicking the account ID link.

=== Payment Methods

In production systems, payment method information is typically added via gateway-specific data flows. However, you can use this Payment Method section for testing purposes.

[WARN]
*Warning!* For PCI compliance, _do not_ enter any genuine payment information in these fields.

==== View Payment Method Details

To view a payment method after it's created:

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. In the Payment Methods area, click the gray down arrow ( image:i_GrayDownArrow.png[] ) next to the payment method.

Kaui expands the details for the payment method:

image::PaymentMethod-Expanded.png[width=450]

==== Set a Payment Method as the Default

Kill Bill uses the default payment method to automatically pay invoices (whether that invoice is generated by the system or manually by a user).

To set a payment method as the default:

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. In the Payment Methods section, click the star icon (image:i_StarClear.png[]) next to the relevant payment method:

image::PaymentMethodStar-Labeled.png[width=350]

The filled star ( image:i_StarFilled.png[] ) indicates it's now the default payment method.

==== Add Payment Method

A customer account can have several payment methods to allow for making payments in different ways, such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and so forth. The payment method includes the details needed for Kill Bill to process a payment against an invoice.

Saving this information in Kaui makes it easier for you to accept payments from the customer, because the customer does not have to repeatedly provide their payment method details.

[NOTE]
*Note:* You cannot edit a payment method once it is created.

To add a payment method for a customer:

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. Next to *Payment Methods*, click the plus sign:

image::PaymentMethods-PlusSign-Labeled.png[width=450]

Kaui displays the Add New Payment Method screen:

image::AddPaymentMethodScreen.png[width=450]

[start=3]
. Fill in the fields. For field information, see the table in the next section.
. Click the *Save* button.
