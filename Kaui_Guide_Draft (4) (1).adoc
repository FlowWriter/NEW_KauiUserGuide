== PART 1

== What Is Kaui?
"Kaui" (KAUI ) stands for Kill (Bill) Admin User Interface. We think "Kaui" is easier on the eyes than "KAUI."

Kaui is a user interface for Kill Bill. You can use Kaui to perform all sorts of back office tasks related to customer accounts. You can also use Kaui to perform more advanced tasks.

== What You Can Do in Kaui

In Kaui, users can  perform basic tasks, such as:

* Create a customer account
* Generate a customer invoice
* Cancel a subscription

However, Kaui can also help advanced users perform tasks, for example:

* Adding a plugin to Kill Bill
* Managing Kill Bill users
* Creating tags or custom fields

These are just a handful of the tasks you can accomplish with Kaui. For a full list, see the Table of Contents at the beginning of this guide.

== How to Use This Guide

*Part 1* explains how Kaui is organized and how to perform basic customer service tasks, such as creating accounts, invoices, and so forth. It’s appropriate for back office staff, such as those working in customer service, product management, and finance.

To quickly find what you're looking for, you can use the _Table of Contents_ or our *FAQs*.

*Part 2* explains advanced features of Kaui, for example: customer fields, tags, extensions, and more. It’s appropriate for Kill Bill administrators and software developers.

=== About Screenshots
The screenshots displayed in this guide may differ from what you see on your Kaui screen. That's because your user permissions control what features you can access (i.e., what you see on the screen).

=== Grids/Tables
Grids (a.k.a. tables) appear throughout Kaui to keep lists organized:

image::GridSample.png[]

Below some grids, you can use the pagination controls to view different "pages:"

image::PaginationControls.png[80,500]

To sort columns on a grid, click the up/down arrow in that column's header:

image::ShowSortArrowsOnColumn.png[width=650]

Kaui shows you which column is currently sorted by the purple arrow:

image::ShowSortByColumn.png[width=650]

The direction of the arrow (up or down) indicates if the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.

If relevant, you can click on a link in the grid to view that item's detail. For example, on the Invoices grid, click the link to open that specific invoice:

image::ClickToViewDetail.png[width=650]

=== Basic Search

*Tip:* To view all accounts, place your cursor in the search field and press the Enter key.

To search for customer accounts, use the basic search. Basic search is available at the top of the screen no matter where you are in Kaui:

image:ShowTopSearch.png[width=850]

Basic search is also available in the center of the *homepage*:

image:ShowSearchHomepage.png[width=850]

You can search on the following information:

* ID
* External key
* Name
* Email address

=== Advanced Search

An advanced search can help you find customer account as well as other types of objects in the system, such as invoices, subscriptions, and so forth.

To perform an advanced search:

1. On the homepage, click *Advanced search:*

image:ShowAdvancedSearch.png[width=850]

Kaui displays the Advanced Search popup:

image:AdvancedSearchPopup.png[width=650]

[start=2]
2. In the *Object type* field, select the object type you want to search for:

image:AdvSearch-ObjectTypeDropdown.png[width=650]

[start=3]
3. In the *Search for* field, enter the identifier (ID) of the object you're searching for. (_Example:_ If you're searching for a specific invoice, type in the invoice number.)

[NOTE]
*Note:* In addition to searching with an ID, some object types can be searched for using an external key, such as the customer account.

[start=4]
4. If you want Kaui to search and display the first record in the search results, click the *Fast search* checkbox.

5. Click the Search button. Kaui displays the search results.

[TIP]
*Tip:* At the bottom of the Advanced Search popup, Kaui displays the search syntax. You can copy and paste this advanced search syntax into a basic search field. This is helpful if you frequently perform the same kinds of advanced searches.

_Example:_

image:AdvancedSearchSyntax-Labeled.png[]

//QST: Do we have a list of objects that can have external keys? Or is that something that's customizable for Kill Bill?
//QST: Are "invoice payments" different from "payments?"
//QST: Can you search with partial IDs or partial external keys? Or does it have to be an exact match?
//QST: Can you use any wildcard characters in the search box?

== Accounts

This section helps you become familiar with customer accounts and the layout of the Account page.

The Account page provides information about a specific customer, such as email address, physical address, and so forth. It is also the central location for the customer's billing information, subscriptions, invoices, and payment methods.

To find a customer in the system, use <<Basic Search>> or <<Advanced Search>>. To open the customer account, click on the customer ID in the search results.

The next section explains how the Account page is laid out. To skip this and see the task-based steps, go to <<Creating an Account.>>

=== Account Page Layout

The Account page has the following sections:

image::AccountPage_Labeled.png[]

1. Sub-menu
2. Account information
3. Personal info
4. Billing info
5. Payment methods

==== Account Sub-Menu

The Account sub-menu organizes and provides access to different areas of the customer's account: Subscriptions, Invoices, Payments, Timeline, Tags, and Custom Fields.

To see these areas, click on the relevant item on the sub-menu. To return to the customer's Account page, click *Account* on the sub-menu.

==== Account Information

This section of the screen displays a summary of the customer's account information, such as their ID, currency, and time zone. To edit this information, click *Edit* next to "Account Information."

Here you can performt he following tasks for the customer account:

* Edit an account
* Define a parent account
* Assign a tag

In this section, you can also assign a tag to the customer or define the parent account. [[LINK EACH OF THESE TOPICS]]

==== Personal Information

This view-only section of the screen displays a read-only list of the customer's personal contact information.

By default, Personal Information is hidden for GDPR Compliance and customer privacy. To see the information, click *Show/Hide Content*.

To edit this information, see the "Edit an Account" section. [[LINK]]

==== Billing Info

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer:

* Pay all invoices
* Add a credit
* Create a charge

You can also see a summary of billing information:

* Account balance - Amount of money due on the account, including any account credits.
* Account credit - Amount of any money owed to the customer.
* Overdue status - The status of the customer's account that indicates if they are overdue or up-to-date on their invoice payments.

[NOTE]
*Note:* The account can have a negative account balance, but not be overdue. That's because overdue status depends on invoice due dates and how late payments are defined based on a company's business policy. For example, an invoice may not be overdue if a company allows a 15 day grace period to make a payment.

* Bill cycle day - The day of the month on which the system generates an invoice.
* Next invoice date - The date on which the system generates the customer's next invoice.

The "Trigger invoice generation" feature lets you generate an invoice, either as a test or in a committed state.

==== Payment Methods

This section of the Account page lets you:

* Add a payment method
* Edit existing payment methods
* Set a payment method as default
* Perform an auth(orize), charge, or credit against a payment method
* Delete a payment method

For more information on payment methods, see [[THIS THAT AND THE OTHER]]

[cols="1,1"]
[cols="25h,~"]
|===
| Field | Description

| Name
| The customer's first and last name.

| First name length
| This field sets the length of the customer's first name. Kill Bill automatically calculates this number based on the location of the space between the first and last name. You can overwrite it with a different number, if necessary.

*Note:* This field gets used if your organization needs to extract customers' first or last names for communication (invoices, emails, etc.). The field lets an organization accommodate variations of names used across the globe.

| External key
| An optional alternate ID for the account. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

*Tip:* The external key feature is helpful if you integrate Kill Bill with another system, such as a CRM, and want to use that system's ID in Kill Bill (for identification, searching, and so forth). Once this is set and saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

| Email
| The main email address to use for communicating with the customer.

| Billing cycle day
| For monthly or quarterly subscriptions, what day of the month the invoice is created. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

| The time zone in which the customer resides. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

| Locale
| Indicates the language that Kaui uses to send communication to the customer (invoices, emails, etc.)  If your organizaton communicates with customers in a language that's different than the default language, it's important to select the appropriate locale for the customer.

|===

//QST: For "contact email addresses," is the definition correct? Also, how do you separate multiple contact email addresses? Comma, space, hard line break?

=== Add Tag(s) to an Account

You can attach a tag to an account as a way of communicating information or to starting/stopping an action. Some examples from the default tags that already exist in the system include:

* The AUTO_INVOICING_OFF tag stops invoicing the customer account until the tag is removed.
* The TEST tag indicates the account is used internally for testing purposes.

For more information on Tags, including a list of default tags, see the https://killbill.github.io/slate/#account-tags["Tags" section] in the _REST API Reference Manual_.

To add a tag to a customer account:

2. In the "Account Information" section, click the tag icon in the upper left corner:

image:AccountInfo-Section-Labeled.png[]

[start=3]
3. Select the checkboxes of the tags you want to assign to the account.

image:Account-TagDropdown.png[]

[start=4]
4. Click the *Update* button to save your changes.

=== Link to Parent Account

When you link an account to a _parent_ account, the account becomes a _child_ account. Defining a parent-child association between accounts lets you define which entity is responsible for paying the invoice. For more information on this feature, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/ha.html#_overview[Hierarchical Accounts Tutorial].

1. As a preparation step, open the parent account and copy the Account ID.
2. Open the account that will become the child account.
3. Next to the *Parent* field, click the plus sign icon in the "Account Information" section:

image:Account-ParentField-Labeled.png[width=650]

Kaui opens a popup:

image:LinkToParentPopup.png[width=650]

[start=4]
4. Click in the *Parent account id* field and paste in the Account ID that you copied in step 1.
5. To set the parent as responsible for all payments associated with this account, check the *Is payment delegated to a parent?* box. If you do not check this box, the child account is responsible for its own payments.

[start=6]
6. Click the *Save* button. Kaui displays the parent account ID as a link in the "Account Information" section.

image:Account-ParentID-Labeled.png[]

[TIP]
*Tip:* To open the parent account from the child account, click on the account ID link next to the *Parent* field.

=== Close an Account
Does not delete the account. Customer is no longer a customer. Once closed, the data will be read-only. "Write off unpaid invoices" and "Item Adjust Unpaid Invoices" are mutually exclusive. [[can't just delete the invoice]]

When you choose to write off the invoice, it is removed from Account Receivables.
