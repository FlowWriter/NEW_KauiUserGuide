== PART 1

== What Is Kaui?
"Kaui" (KAUI ) stands for Kill (Bill) Admin User Interface. We think "Kaui" is easier on the eyes than "KAUI."

Kaui is a user interface for Kill Bill. You can use Kaui to perform all sorts of back office tasks related to customer accounts. You can also use Kaui to perform more advanced tasks.

== What You Can Do in Kaui

In Kaui, users can  perform basic tasks, such as:

* Create a customer account
* Generate a customer invoice
* Cancel a subscription

However, Kaui can also help advanced users perform tasks, for example:

* Adding a plugin to Kill Bill
* Managing Kill Bill users
* Creating tags or custom fields

These are just a handful of the tasks you can accomplish with Kaui. For a full list, see the Table of Contents at the beginning of this guide.

== How to Use This Guide

*Part 1* explains how Kaui is organized and how to perform basic customer service tasks, such as creating accounts, invoices, and so forth. It’s appropriate for back office staff, such as those working in customer service, product management, and finance.

To quickly find what you're looking for, you can use the _Table of Contents_ or our <<FAQs>> section.

*Part 2* explains advanced features of Kaui, for example: customer fields, tags, extensions, and more. It’s appropriate for Kill Bill administrators and software developers.

=== About Screenshots
The screenshots displayed in this guide may differ from what you see on your Kaui screen. That's because your user permissions control what features you can access (i.e., what you see on the screen).

== Other Learning Resources

=== Glossary

Some of the terms may have a slightly different meaning from your previous encounters with them. For that reason, we encourage you to review the following terms in the  _Kill Bill Glossary_:

Account | External Key | Parent | Payment Method | Subscription | Tag | Tenant | User

=== Videos
We regularly add new overviews and tutorials to https://www.youtube.com/c/KillbillIoOSS[our YouTube videos], so check in from time to time.

== Log In and Log Out [[log_in_and_log_out]]

To log in to Kaui, type in your username and password, then select the *Sign In* button.

image::LoginScreen.png[width=650]

If your organization uses more than one Kill Bill tenant, select the tenant from the dropdown and select the *Save* button:

image::ChooseTenant.png[width=650]

[NOTE]
*Note:* Authentication is handled by Kill Bill. The method your organization uses to manage users is highly configurable. For information on managing users and permissions, see <<users_roles_permissions>>.

To log out of Kaui, select *SIGN OUT* in the upper right corner of the Kill Bill homepage:

=== Grids/Tables [[grids_tables]]
Grids (a.k.a. tables) appear throughout Kaui to keep lists organized:

image::GridSample.png[]

Below some grids, you can use the pagination controls to view different "pages:"

image::PaginationControls.png[80,500]

To sort columns on a grid, click the up/down arrow in that column's header:

image::ShowSortArrowsOnColumn.png[width=650]

Kaui shows you which column is currently sorted by the purple arrow:

image::ShowSortByColumn.png[width=650]

The direction of the arrow (up or down) indicates if the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.

If relevant, you can click on a link in the grid to view that item's detail. For example, on the Invoices grid, click the link to open that specific invoice:

image::ClickToViewDetail.png[width=650]

=== Basic Search

*Tip:* To view all accounts, place your cursor in the search field and press the Enter key.

To search for customer accounts, use the basic search. Basic search is available at the top of the screen no matter where you are in Kaui:

image::ShowTopSearch.png[width=850]

Basic search is also available in the center of the *homepage*:

image::ShowSearchHomepage.png[width=850]

You can search on the following information:

* ID
* External key
* Name
* Email address

=== Advanced Search

An advanced search can help you find customer account as well as other types of objects in the system, such as invoices, subscriptions, and so forth.

To perform an advanced search:

1. On the homepage, click *Advanced search:*

image::ShowAdvancedSearch.png[width=850]

Kaui displays the Advanced Search popup:

image::AdvancedSearchPopup.png[width=650]

[start=2]
2. In the *Object type* field, select the object type you want to search for:

image::AdvSearch-ObjectTypeDropdown.png[width=650]

[start=3]
3. In the *Search for* field, enter the identifier (ID) of the object you're searching for. (_Example:_ If you're searching for a specific invoice, type in the invoice number.)

[NOTE]
*Note:* In addition to searching with an ID, some object types can be searched for using an external key, such as the customer account.

[start=4]
4. If you want Kaui to search and display the first record in the search results, click the *Fast search* checkbox.

5. Click the Search button. Kaui displays the search results.

[TIP]
*Tip:* At the bottom of the Advanced Search popup, Kaui displays the search syntax. You can copy and paste this advanced search syntax into a basic search field. This is helpful if you frequently perform the same kinds of advanced searches.

_Example:_

image::AdvancedSearchSyntax-Labeled.png[]

== Accounts

This section helps you become familiar with customer accounts and the layout of the Account page.

The Account page provides information about a specific customer, such as email address, physical address, and so forth. It is also the central location for the customer's billing information, subscriptions, invoices, and payment methods.

To find a customer in the system, use <<Basic Search>> or <<Advanced Search>>. To open the customer account, click on the customer ID in the search results.

The next section explains how the Account page is laid out. To skip this and see the task-based steps, go to <<Create an Account>>.

=== Account Page Layout

The Account page has the following sections:

1. Sub-menu
2. Account information
3. Billing info
4. Personal info
5. Payment methods

image::AccountPage_Labeled.png[]

*1. Account Sub-Menu*

The Account sub-menu organizes and provides access to different areas of the customer's account:

* Subscriptions
* Invoices
* Payments
* Timeline
* Tags*
* Custom Fields*

*Tags and custom fields are advanced features and documented in Part 3 of the documentation.

image::Account-Submenu.png[width=650]

To see these areas, click on the relevant item on the sub-menu. To return to the customer's Account page, click *Account* on the sub-menu.

*2. Account Information*

This section of the screen displays a summary of the customer's account information, such as their ID, currency, and time zone. To edit this information, click *Edit* next to "Account Information."

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer account:

* <<_edit_an_account>>
* <<_link_to_parent_account>>
* <<_add_a_tag_to_an_account>>

In this section, you can also assign a tag to the customer or define the parent account.

*3. Personal Information*

This view-only section of the screen displays a read-only list of the customer's personal contact information.

By default, Personal Information is hidden for GDPR Compliance and customer privacy. To see the information, click *Show/Hide Content*.

To edit this information, see the <<_edit_an_account>> section.

*4. Billing Info*

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer:

* Pay all invoices
* Add a credit
* Create a charge

You can also see a summary of billing information:

* Account balance - Amount of money due on the account, including any account credits.
* Account credit - Amount of any money owed to the customer.
* Overdue status - The status of the customer's account that indicates if they are overdue or up-to-date on their invoice payments.

[NOTE]
*Note:* The account can have a negative account balance, but not be overdue. That's because overdue status depends on invoice due dates and how late payments are defined based on a company's business policy. For example, an invoice may not be overdue if a company allows a 15-day grace period (a.k.a. NET terms) to make a payment.

* Bill cycle day - The day of the month on which the system generates an invoice.
* Next invoice date - The date on which the system generates the customer's next invoice.

The *Trigger invoice generation* feature lets you generate an invoice, either as a test or in a committed state.

*5. Payment Methods*

This section of the Account page lets you:

* <<_add_payment_method>>
* Set a payment method as default
* Delete a payment method
* Perform an auth(orize), charge, or credit against a payment method

[NOTE]
*Note:* The auth, charge, and credit operations are directly applied on the payment instrument (as opposed to being applied to the unpaid invoice). Additionally, "credit" here refers to depositing funds directly to the customer card and is unrelated to account credits.

For more information on payment methods, see the <<_payment_methods>> section.

[[QST: What is the star icon for? Default account?]]

==== Account Field Information

[cols="1,1"]
[cols="25h,~"]
|===
| Field | Description

| Name
| The customer's first and last name.

| First name length
| This field sets the length of the customer's first name. Kill Bill automatically calculates this number based on the location of the space between the first and last name. You can overwrite it with a different number, if necessary.

*Note:* This field gets used if your organization needs to extract customers' first or last names for communication (invoices, emails, etc.). The field lets an organization accommodate variations of names used across the globe.

| External key
| An optional alternate ID for the account. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

*Tip:* The external key feature is helpful if you integrate Kill Bill with another system, such as a CRM, and want to use that system's ID in Kill Bill (for identification, searching, and so forth). Once this is set and saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

| Email
| The main email address to use for communicating with the customer.

| Billing cycle day
| For monthly or quarterly subscriptions, what day of the month the invoice is created. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

| Locale
| Indicates the language that Kaui uses to send communication to the customer (invoices, emails, etc.)  If your organizaton communicates with customers in a language that's different than the default language, it's important to select the appropriate locale for the customer.

|===

//QST: For "contact email addresses," is the definition correct? Also, how do you separate multiple contact email addresses? Comma, space, hard line break?

image::TimelinePage.png[]

=== Close an Account
Use the steps in this section to indicate you will no longer be doing business with a customer. If the customer has unpaid invoices, using the steps below, you can choose to either write off or item-adjust them.

[NOTE]
*Note:* Closing an account does not delete it. It only indicates the account is no longer a customer of yours. Once you close the account, its data becomes read-only, and you cannot make changes to it.

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. Next to "Account Information," click *Close*.

Kaui displays the Close Account pop-up:

image::CloseAccountPopup.png[width=650]

[start=3]
3. Check the *Name* and *Account ID* fields to ensure you are closing the correct account.
4. Select any of the following actions:

* *Cancel All Subscriptions*&#8212;Stops any subscriptions that are current for this account.

* *Write Off Unpaid Invoices*&#8212;Brings the balance for all unpaid invoices to zero. When you choose to write off the invoice, it is removed from Account Receivables.

* *Item Adjust Unpaid Invoices*&#8212;Adds an invoice line item with a negative amount to bring each unpaid invoice's balance to zero.

[NOTE]
*Note:* The last two options are mutually exclusive (i.e., you can only select one of them).

[start=5]
5. Click the *Close* button.

Kaui displays a message that lets you know the account was closed. In addition, the Account menu displays "Closed":

image::AccountSubmenu-Closed.png[width=650]

=== Add a Tag to an Account

You can attach a tag to an account as a way of communicating information or to starting/stopping an action. Some examples from the default tags that already exist in the system include:

* The AUTO_INVOICING_OFF tag stops invoicing the customer account until the tag is removed.
* The TEST tag indicates the account is used internally for testing purposes.

For more information on Tags, including a list of default tags, see the https://killbill.github.io/slate/#account-tags["Tags" section] in the _REST API Reference Manual_.

To add a tag to a customer account:

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. In the "Account Information" section, click the tag icon in the upper left corner:

image::AccountInfo-Section-Labeled.png[width=650]

[start=3]
3. Select the checkboxes of the tags you want to assign to the account.

image::Account-TagDropdown.png[width=650]

[start=4]
4. Click the *Update* button to save your changes.

=== Link to Parent Account

When you link an account to a _parent_ account, the account becomes a _child_ account. Defining a parent-child association between accounts lets you define which entity is responsible for paying the invoice. For more information on this feature, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/ha.html#_overview[Hierarchical Accounts Tutorial].

1. As a preparation step, open the parent account and copy the Account ID.
2. Open the account that will become the child account.
3. Next to the *Parent* field, click the plus sign icon in the "Account Information" section:

image::Account-ParentField-Labeled.png[width=650]

Kaui opens a popup:

image::LinkToParentPopup.png[width=650]

[start=4]
4. Click in the *Parent account id* field and paste in the Account ID that you copied in step 1.
5. To set the parent as responsible for all payments associated with this account, check the *Is payment delegated to a parent?* box. If you do not check this box, the child account is responsible for its own payments.

[start=6]
6. Click the *Save* button. Kaui displays the parent account ID as a link in the "Account Information" section.

image::Account-ParentID-Labeled.png[width=650]

[TIP]
*Tip:* To open the parent account from the child account, click on the account ID link next to the *Parent* field.

=== Payment Methods

In production systems, payment method information is typically added via gateway-specific data flows. However, you can use this Payment Method section for testing purposes. For PCI compliance, _do not_ enter any genuine payment information in these fields.

==== Add Payment Method

A customer account can have several payment methods to allow making payments in  different ways, such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and so forth. The payment method includes the details needed for Kill Bill to process a payment against an invoice. (For more information about payment methods, see )

Saving this information in Kaui makes it easier for you to accept payments from the customer, because the customer does not have to repeatedly give you their payment method details.

[TIP]
*Tip:* If you set a payment method as the default, Kill Bill will automatically process any open invoices for the account.

[[mention something about how it's saved as a token and not actual data?]]

To add a payment method for a customer:

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. Next to "Payment Methods," click the plus sign:
